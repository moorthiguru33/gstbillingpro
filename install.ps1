# Free GST Billing - one-command Windows installer.

#   irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IamRamgarhia/Free-GST-Billing-Software/main/install.ps1 | iex
#
# Does what a user doing it by hand would do: download the latest release
# ZIP, extract it, run the installer inside it. Nothing else. There is no
# elevation, no registry writing and no service - the app installs under
# the user's own profile.
#
# It runs through `iex`, so it cannot take -Parameters. Point it somewhere
# else with an environment variable instead:
#
#   $env:FREEGSTBILL_DIR = 'D:\Apps\Free GST Billing'
#
# Keep this file pure ASCII: it is fetched and parsed by Windows
# PowerShell 5.1, which mangles UTF-8 without a BOM (see ERR-001).
