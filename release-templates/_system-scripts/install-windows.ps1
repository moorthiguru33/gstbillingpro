#
# This used to run the official .msi with /qn. That installer writes to
# C:\Program Files\nodejs, which needs administrator rights - and /qn means
# "fully silent", so Windows cannot even show the UAC prompt that would grant
# them. On a standard account, or a work laptop, or any PC where the user is
# not a local admin, it simply did nothing. The exit code was never checked,
# so the script marched on to npm install, which failed with
# "npm is not recognized" - and the person was told "npm install failed",
# which tells them nothing they can act on.
#
# The official portable ZIP needs no rights at all: unpack it next to the app
# and point PATH at it. Nothing is written outside this folder, no UAC prompt
# appears, and a Node.js the user already has is left completely alone.
