  <li><strong>Check everything</strong>The supplier, GSTIN, invoice number, date and grand total are filled in, with the line items it could read: name, HSN, quantity, rate and GST rate.

<h2>The template list</h2>
<p>Each template shows the client, how often (such as "Every 3 months"), type, amount, next due date and whether it is <b>Active</b> or <b>Paused</b>. Its buttons: ${ui('▶')} Generate Now, Pause or Activate, Edit, and Delete. Editing keeps everything the form does not show, such as terms and options from the original invoice. Deleting a template stops future invoices; invoices already made stay.</p>
<p>When templates are due, a banner lists them, with a button for each to create its invoice now.</p>

<section id="automatic">
<h2>How invoices are created automatically</h2>
<p>A few seconds after the app starts, and then once a day while it is running, every active template whose date has come creates its invoice, with a fresh number and that day's date. Its next date then moves on by the schedule, and it stops at its end condition.</p>
<p>The notification bell tells you how many were created. They appear on the Dashboard, ready to check and send.</p>
<p>If the app was closed for a while, one invoice is created each time it catches up, so a missed month is not skipped.</p>
</section>

<section id="generate-now">
<h2>Generate Now</h2>
<p>${ui('▶')} creates the invoice straight away, even if the template is paused or not yet due, exactly as the automatic run would: same tax, a fresh number, today's date. Its next date moves on by the schedule and it counts towards "After N invoices". Once a template has reached its end, it says so instead. Open the new invoice from the Dashboard to check it before sending.</p>

<section id="receipt-list">
<h2>The receipts list</h2>
<p>${ui('Receipts')} lists every receipt, newest first: date, receipt number, client, the invoice it was against, amount and mode. Search by client or receipt number. Each row can be printed, edited or deleted.</p>
<p>Recording a payment on the <a href="dashboard.html#payments">Dashboard</a> makes its own receipt, which you print from the payment history there.</p>

<section id="new-receipt">
<h2>Making a receipt</h2>
<ol class="steps">
  <li><strong>Start it</strong>Click ${ui('New Receipt')}.</li>
  <li><strong>Pick the invoice, if there is one</strong><b>Quick Select, Unpaid Invoices</b> lists up to 50 unpaid sales invoices. Picking one fills in the client, the amount still owed and the invoice number.</li>
  <li><strong>Fill in the rest</strong>Date, <b>Received From</b> (required), <b>Amount</b> (required), <b>Payment Mode</b>, <b>Reference / Transaction No</b>, <b>Against Invoice</b> and a note.</li>
  <li><strong>Save</strong>${ui('Save Receipt')} gives it the next receipt number.</li>
</ol>
<p>When <b>Against Invoice</b> exactly matches one of your invoice numbers, the payment is also recorded on that invoice, and its status becomes Partial or Paid. If it does not match any invoice, the receipt is saved on its own and you are told so.</p>
</section>

<section id="numbers">
<h2>Receipt numbers</h2>
<p>Receipts have their own series, starting RCP, and follow your <a href="settings.html#invoice-numbers">invoice number format</a>: separator, financial year and digits. If you set a brand prefix, it is used for receipts too. The next number is given when you save, unless you typed your own, which is kept.</p>
</section>

<section id="print">
<h2>Printing</h2>
<p>The print button opens the receipt in a new window and your print dialog. It shows your business name, address and GSTIN, <b>PAYMENT RECEIPT</b>, the receipt number, date, who paid, how, the reference and invoice, the amount in figures and words, any note, and lines for <b>Received By</b> and <b>Authorized Signatory</b>. If nothing happens, allow pop-ups for the app in your browser.</p>
</section>

<section id="delete">
<h2>Deleting a receipt</h2>
<p>Deleting a receipt removes only the receipt. A payment it recorded on an invoice stays there; delete that from the invoice's payment history on the Dashboard if it was a mistake.</p>
