  body: `
<section id="sidebar">
<h2>The sidebar</h2>
<p>From top to bottom:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Your business</strong>, with a pencil to edit it. If you have more than one, click the name to <a href="#switch-business">switch</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>The screens</strong>: Dashboard, New Invoice, Clients, Products, Expenses, Purchases, Recurring, Receipts, Reports, GST Returns, Income Tax, and <strong>User Guide</strong>, which opens this documentation in your browser (it needs internet). Features you <a href="settings.html#modules">turn off</a> disappear from here.</li>
  <li><strong>Update to v…</strong>, when a new version is out.</li>
  <li><strong>Notifications</strong>, <strong>Dark Mode</strong> or <strong>Light Mode</strong>, <a href="#support"><strong>Support &amp; About</strong></a>, <strong>Control Panel</strong> and <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>
  <li>At the bottom, <b>App Ready</b> when all is well.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the Dashboard, below the invoices, a small line shows the app's version, a link to DiceCodes and <a href="#support">Support</a>. It is never printed.</p>
<p>On a narrow screen, the sidebar folds away behind the ☰ menu button.</p>
</section>

<section id="support">
<h2>Support &amp; About</h2>
<p>Who makes the app, and how to help it grow. Free ways come first: star it on GitHub, tell another business, report a bug or ask for a feature. If you want to give money, scan the UPI QR with any UPI app, for any amount. The page also lists what DiceCodes builds for businesses: custom software and web apps, changes to this app, setup and data migration, support plans, AI integration and automation, and mobile apps.</p>
<p>The app stays free whatever you choose. Nothing is locked, and nothing is ever printed on your invoices. After your 50th invoice, the Dashboard shows one small thank-you card; ${ui('Maybe later')} hides it for a few months and ${ui("Don't show again")} hides it for good.</p>
<p>Once a month at most, a one-line note at the top of the app asks for a star on GitHub. ${ui('✕')} hides it for 30 days; ${ui('Star on GitHub')} or ${ui('Already starred')} hides it for good. It never appears while you are making an invoice.</p>
</section>

<section id="switch-business">
<h2>Switching business</h2>
<p>With more than one business saved, click its name at the top of the sidebar and choose another. Every screen changes to that business's invoices, purchases, expenses, receipts, recurring invoices, reports and returns. <b>Manage profiles…</b> opens <a href="settings.html#multiple-businesses">Settings</a>.</p>
</section>

<section id="notifications">
<h2>Notifications</h2>
<p>The bell shows a count of things that need you. Clicking it lists them, and clicking one takes you there:</p>
<ul>
  <li>🔁 recurring invoices created today</li>
  <li>⚠ overdue invoices</li>
  <li>⏰ invoices due in the next 3 days</li>
  <li>📋 GST, TDS, TCS, advance tax and ITR dates in the next 10 days</li>
  <li>📦 products low on stock</li>
</ul>
<p>${ui('Mark all as read')} clears the list. Anything new brings it back. The bell counts all your businesses together.</p>
</section>

<section id="command-palette">
<h2>Quick search: Ctrl + K</h2>
<p>Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> anywhere, even while typing, and start typing. You can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>go to any screen, or start a new invoice;</li>
  <li>open an invoice by its number or client;</li>
  <li>find a client by name or GSTIN, or a product by name or HSN, which opens their list;</li>
  <li>jump to Settings, switch dark mode, or see what is new in an update.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use <kbd>↑</kbd> <kbd>↓</kbd> and <kbd>Enter</kbd>. <kbd>Esc</kbd> closes it.</p>

<p>On the invoice screen there are more: see <a href="invoices.html#keyboard">Keyboard shortcuts on this screen</a>. On a Mac, use <kbd>⌘</kbd> instead of <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>.</p>
</section>

<section id="dark-mode">
<h2>Dark mode</h2>
<p>${ui('Dark Mode')} in the sidebar switches the app to dark colours, and ${ui('Light Mode')} switches back. Invoices and PDFs always print in their normal colours.</p>
</section>

<section id="install-as-app">
<h2>Opening it like a desktop app</h2>
<p>In Chrome and Edge, the app may offer ${ui('Install App')}. It then opens in its own window with its own icon, like any other program, and right-clicking the icon jumps straight to New Invoice or GST Returns. It is the same app and the same data.</p>
</section>

<section id="app-not-running">
<h2>"Needs a Quick Start"</h2>
<p>If the app's engine is not running, the page says <b>Free GST Billing Software Needs a Quick Start</b>. Your data is safe. Double-click <b>Free GST Billing</b> on your Desktop and click ${ui('Open App')}; the page carries on by itself once it is running.</p>

<section id="files-missing">
<h2>The launcher says files are missing, or to extract the ZIP</h2>
<p>The launcher was opened from inside the ZIP, or the ZIP was only partly extracted. Close it, right-click the ZIP, choose ${ui('Extract All…')}, and open the launcher from the extracted folder. Keep the launcher and the <code>_system</code> folder together. See <a href="install.html#extract-first">Extract the ZIP before opening anything</a>.</p>
</section>

<section id="windows-protected">
<h2>Windows blocked the launcher</h2>
<p>Click ${ui('More info')}, then ${ui('Run anyway')}. If it still will not open, right-click the launcher, choose ${ui('Properties')} and tick ${ui('Unblock')}. See <a href="install.html#windows-protected">"Windows protected your PC"</a>.</p>
</section>

<section id="install-failed">
<h2>The install stopped with an error</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>"Could not download Node.js"</strong> or <strong>"could not install the app's dependencies"</strong>: the first install needs the internet. Check the connection, or a work proxy or firewall, and click ${ui('Install')} again. It carries on where it stopped.</li>
  <li><strong>"Node.js was downloaded but will not run"</strong>: antivirus probably removed it. Add the app's folder to your antivirus exclusions, or install Node.js yourself from <a href="https://nodejs.org">nodejs.org</a>, then click ${ui('Install')} again.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="cannot-connect">
<h2>"Cannot connect", a blank page, or "Needs a Quick Start"</h2>
<p>The app is not running. Open the <b>Free GST Billing</b> shortcut and click ${ui('Open App')}; it starts the app if needed and opens the right address. You never need to type the address yourself; if its usual port is busy, the app picks another and the shortcut follows it.</p>
</section>

<section id="wrong-tax">
<h2>The invoice has the wrong tax split</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Check your own <b>state</b> in <a href="settings.html#company-details">Settings</a>.</li>
  <li>Check the <b>client's state</b>, or their GSTIN, which fills the state in.</li>
  <li>If goods go to a different state from the client's address, set <b>Place of Supply</b> on the invoice.</li>
  <li>For a client abroad, set their <b>country</b>: it is then an export, charged as IGST. For an SEZ unit, tick <b>SEZ</b> on the client.</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="invoices.html#gst">How GST is worked out</a>.</p>
</section>

<section id="no-tax">
<h2>No GST is charged at all</h2>
<p>The <b>Tax % column</b> is probably turned off under ${ui('Customize')}. Turning it off removes GST from the invoice, and your choice carries over to new invoices. Tick it again. Bills of supply and delivery challans never charge GST.</p>
</section>

<section id="missing-on-pdf">
<h2>Something is missing from the PDF</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Logo, signature or stamp</strong>: check it is uploaded and saved in <a href="settings.html#branding">Settings</a>, and ticked under Customize.</li>
  <li><strong>UPI QR code</strong>: needs a UPI ID on the account, a rupee invoice, and <b>UPI QR</b> ticked under Customize.</li>
  <li><strong>Bank details or PAN</strong>: tick <b>Bank details</b> under Customize; the account needs a bank name.</li>
  <li><strong>Anything on a receipt printer</strong>: receipts leave some things out on purpose. See <a href="thermal-printing.html#not-on-receipts">What a receipt leaves out</a>.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="gstr1-blocked">
<h2>GSTR-1 export says "blocked"</h2>
<p>An invoice number is too long or has characters the portal refuses, or an item has a GST rate the portal does not accept. The message names the first one. See <a href="gst-returns.html#json-checks">Checks before the file is made</a>.</p>
</section>

<section id="update-failed">
<h2>An update went wrong</h2>
<p>Your data folder is never changed by an update, and a backup was saved in <code>Documents\\FreeGSTBill Backups</code> before it started. Run the update again, which fixes most problems. If it still fails, download the ZIP and extract it over the app folder by hand.</p>
</section>

<section id="gst-labels">
<h2>It says VAT instead of GST, or the other way round</h2>
<p>Change <a href="settings.html#region">Region</a> in Settings, and check your country in Company Details. Tax names follow the seller's country.</p>
</section>

<section id="ocr-failed">
<h2>Reading a bill photo failed</h2>
<p>Use a sharp, straight, well-lit JPG or PNG under 8 MB, cropped to the bill. If it still fails, reload the page with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd> and try again, or enter the bill by hand.</p>
</section>

<section id="other-devices">
<h2>Can I use it on my phone or another computer?</h2>
<p>The app runs on the computer it is installed on, and only that computer can open it. It has no login, so it is deliberately not shared over your network, where anyone connected could read your books. To work on another computer, <a href="backup.html#move-pc">move your data</a> there.</p>
</section>

<section id="internet">
<h2>Does it need the internet?</h2>
<p>Only to install and to update. Invoices, reports, GST returns and even reading bills from photos all work offline. Google Drive upload uses the internet too.</p>
</section>

<section id="privacy">
<h2>Is my data sent anywhere?</h2>
<p>No. There is no account, no tracking and no server of ours. Your data stays in the app's folder unless you choose Google Drive, which copies files into your own Drive.</p>
</section>

<section id="report-problem">
<h2>Reporting a problem</h2>
<p>Open an issue on <a href="${SITE.repo}/issues">GitHub</a> with a screenshot, the version from <b>Settings, App Updates</b>, and what you did just before it happened. Fixes and new versions come from these reports.</p>

<section id="e-invoicing">
<h2>E-invoicing (IRN and signed QR)</h2>
<p>The app does not connect to the Invoice Registration Portal, so it cannot get an IRN or the signed QR code. If your turnover makes e-invoicing compulsory for you, generate the IRN on the IRP and keep it with the invoice.</p>
</section>

<section id="portal-filing">
<h2>Filing returns for you</h2>

  <li><strong>Debit notes</strong> are not supported as a document type.</li>

<section id="accounting">
<h2>Full accounting</h2>
<p>There is no double-entry ledger, balance sheet, bank reconciliation or journal entries. It covers invoicing, receivables, purchases, expenses, stock counts and GST. For the rest, give your CA the CSV exports.</p>
</section>

<section id="multi-user">
<h2>Several people, or several computers</h2>
<p>There are no logins or user roles, and the app only opens on the computer it runs on. One computer holds the books; see <a href="backup.html#move-pc">moving to a new computer</a>.</p>

<section id="income-tax-limits">
<h2>Income tax</h2>
<p>The income tax helper estimates tax for FY 2025-26, for someone under 60. It does not file your return or produce the ITR file the portal takes. See <a href="income-tax.html">Income tax helper</a>.</p>
