<section id="save-bar">
<h2>Saving your changes</h2>
<p>The section buttons stay at the top of Settings as you scroll: each jumps straight to its section, and the one you are reading is highlighted. At the bottom, one bar saves the whole page. It shows <b>✓ All changes saved</b>, or, in amber, which sections have unsaved changes, with ${ui('Discard')} to undo them all and ${ui('Save all changes')} to save them all in one click.</p>
<p>Not everything waits for a Save. Save all changes covers every section in the last two columns:</p>
<table>
  <tr><th>Saves by itself as you change it</th><th>Has its own Save button</th><th>Needs Save Profile</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Payment accounts, Modules, Region</td><td>Invoice number format, Low-stock alerts, Terms templates</td><td>Company details, PAN, logo, signature, stamp, GSTR filing details, Google Drive fields</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The row of buttons under the title jumps to each section.</p>
</section>

<section id="company-details">
<h2>Company details</h2>
<p>The header of every invoice.</p>
<div class="table-wrap"><table>
  <tr><th>Field</th><th>What to know</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Business Name</td><td>Required</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Country</td><td>India to start. The list follows your <a href="#region">Region</a>.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Address, City, PIN Code</td><td></td></tr>
  <tr><td>State</td><td>The one to get right: it decides whether GST is split into CGST and SGST or charged as IGST</td></tr>
  <tr><td>GSTIN</td><td>Warns if the format looks wrong. The label changes for other countries, such as VAT or TRN.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Email, Phone</td><td></td></tr>
</table></div>
</section>

<section id="gstr-details">
<h2>GSTR filing details</h2>
<p>Indian businesses only, and only used in the <a href="gst-returns.html#json-checks">GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B files</a>. All optional.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Aggregate turnover (AATO) is above ₹5 crore</strong>: tick it if so. HSN codes then need 6 digits instead of 4.</li>
  <li><strong>Previous FY aggregate turnover</strong> and <strong>Current FY turnover so far</strong>, in rupees. You can also change these on the portal while filing.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="payment-accounts">
<h2>Bank accounts and UPI</h2>
<p>Add as many bank and UPI accounts as you like with ${ui('+ Add account')}. Each account has:</p>
<div class="table-wrap"><table>
  <tr><th>Field</th><th>What to know</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Label</td><td>Your name for it, such as "HDFC Current - 1234"</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Account Holder Name</td><td>Leave blank to use your business name</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Bank Name, Account Number</td><td></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Account Type</td><td>Optional: Savings, Current, Cash Credit, Overdraft, NRE or NRO</td></tr>
  <tr><td>IFSC Code</td><td>Or the local bank code outside India</td></tr>
  <tr><td>SWIFT / BIC</td><td>Optional, for payments from abroad</td></tr>
  <tr><td>UPI ID</td><td>Optional. With one, rupee invoices using this account carry a QR code the client can scan to pay the exact amount.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Internal notes</td><td>Never printed</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Set as default</td><td>The ⭐ account is used on new invoices</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>In the list, each account has buttons to make it the default (⭐), move it up or down, switch it off or on, edit and delete it. Switched-off accounts are not offered on new invoices. Deleting one never changes invoices already made with it: they keep the bank details they were saved with.</p>
<p>Pick a different account for one invoice under <a href="invoice-options.html#tds-tcs-account">Customize</a>.</p>
<p><b>PAN Number</b>, below the accounts, prints in the bank details block. It needs Save Profile.</p>
<p>If you set up bank details in an older version, a banner offers ${ui('Import &amp; continue')} to turn them into your first account.</p>
</section>

<section id="invoice-numbers">
<h2>Invoice number format</h2>
<p>The preview at the top shows exactly how the next number will look.</p>
<table>
  <tr><td>Branded Sequential</td><td><code>PREFIX/2026-27/0001</code>, with the financial year. The default.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Simple Sequential</td><td><code>PREFIX/0001</code></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Random</td><td><code>PREFIX/A3X9K2</code></td></tr>
</table>
<p>Under ${ui('⚙ Customize prefix, separator &amp; padding')}:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Brand Prefix</strong>: up to 10 capital letters and digits, such as ACME. Leave it empty to use each type's own prefix: INV, EST, BOS, COMP, CN and DC.</li>
  <li><strong>Separator</strong>: <code>/</code>, <code>-</code> or <code>#</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Include Financial Year</strong>: yes or no.</li>
  <li><strong>Number Padding</strong>: 3 to 6 digits, such as 0001.</li>
</ul>
<p>Click ${ui('Save Number Format')}. Each document type keeps its own count. A type can also have its own prefix in <a href="print-settings.html#prefixes">Print Settings</a>.</p>

</section>

<section id="branding">
<h2>Logo, signature and stamp</h2>
<p>Upload each one separately. Any image up to 5 MB works; large images are made smaller for you. A signature or stamp on a transparent PNG looks best. Each has a size slider: logo 24 to 80 pixels high, signature 30 to 110, stamp 30 to 120.</p>
<p>Click ${ui('Save Profile')} to keep them. The signature and stamp print side by side above the signatory's name, and on a long invoice they always move to the next page together rather than being split.</p>
<p>A photo from an iPhone in HEIC format may not open; share it as JPEG first.</p>
</section>

<section id="multiple-businesses">
<h2>More than one business</h2>
<p>If you run more than one business, each gets its own profile with its own GSTIN, bank accounts, logo and signature, and its <b>own books</b>. Invoices, totals, purchases, expenses, receipts, recurring invoices, reports and GST returns all follow the business selected at the top of the sidebar.</p>
<ul>
  <li>${ui('+ Add New Profile')} saves the business on screen to the list, then clears the form for the new one. Fill it in and click Save Profile.</li>
  <li>${ui('Save as Profile')} saves the form into the list, or updates the entry with the same name.</li>
  <li>${ui('Switch')} on a card changes business. The current one is saved first.</li>
  <li>Deleting a profile only removes it from the list. Its invoices stay.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your client list is shared by all businesses. Records made before you had several businesses show under all of them until you <a href="purchases.html#unassigned">assign them</a>.</p>
</section>

<section id="terms">
<h2>Terms and conditions templates</h2>
<p>Keep the terms you use as templates, then pick one on each invoice.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Quick Start</strong>: one click adds a ready-made set for Services, Goods, Manufacturing and Trading, Export, or Freelancer.</li>
  <li>${ui('+ New Template')}: give it a name and paste your terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Deleting a template does not change invoices that used it.</p>
</section>

<section id="print-settings">
<h2>Print and PDF settings</h2>
<p>The app-wide look of every invoice has its own page: <a href="print-settings.html">Print and PDF settings</a>.</p>
</section>

<section id="modules">
<h2>Turning features off</h2>
<p>Untick anything you do not use, and it disappears from the sidebar and forms. Your data is kept, and ticking it again brings it all back.</p>

<h2>Low-stock alerts</h2>
<p><b>Show low-stock alerts</b> is on to start. Set the threshold with a chip, 0, 3, 5 (recommended) or 10, or type a number, then click ${ui('Save')}. With alerts off, stock is still counted; you are just not warned.</p>
</section>

<section id="region">

<section id="backups">
<h2>Daily backups and the trash bin</h2>
<p>Settings lists the automatic daily backups, with ${ui('Backup now')}, ${ui('Restore')} and ${ui('Delete')}, and the trash bin for deleted invoices. See <a href="backup.html#automatic-backups">Automatic daily backups</a> and <a href="backup.html#trash">Trash</a>.</p>
</section>

<section id="google-drive">
<h2>Google Drive</h2>
<p><strong>The easy way</strong>: install <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/download/">Google Drive for Desktop</a>, sign in, and move the app's <code>Saved Invoices</code> folder into your Drive, or set it to sync. Every PDF you download is then in your Drive, on any device. No setup in the app is needed.</p>
<p><strong>Direct upload</strong>, under <b>Advanced</b>, is for people comfortable with Google Cloud: it needs a Google OAuth Client ID of your own. Enter it and a folder name, click Save Profile, then ${ui('Connect Google Drive')}. After that, ${ui('Save &amp; Download')} uploads each invoice PDF, and a backup can be saved to Drive when exporting.</p>
</section>

<section id="data">
<h2>Import and export (Data Management)</h2>
<p>${ui('Export Backup…')} and ${ui('Import Backup…')} move your data in and out as one file. See <a href="backup.html#export-import">Export everything to one file</a>.</p>
</section>

<section id="updates">
<h2>Updates</h2>
<p>${ui('Check for Updates')} shows your version and the latest. If there is a newer one, ${ui('Update Now')} backs up your data and installs it; reload the page when it finishes. See <a href="backup.html#update">Updating</a>.</p>

  <li>${ui('Backup now')} makes one straight away.</li>
  <li>${ui('Restore')} puts all your data back as it was on that day. It saves what you have now first, so you can go back if it looks wrong. Reload the page afterwards.</li>

<section id="export-import">
<h2>Export everything to one file</h2>
<p>In <b>Settings, Data Management</b>, ${ui('Export Backup…')} lets you tick what to include; everything is ticked to start:</p>
<p>active business profile, all business profiles, invoices, clients, products, expenses, purchase bills, recurring invoices, receipts, terms templates, app settings, and local preferences such as custom units and theme.</p>
<p>${ui('Download Backup')} saves <code>freegstbill-backup-<i>date</i>.json</code>. Tick <b>Also save a copy to my Google Drive</b> if you have connected Drive.</p>
<p>${ui('Import Backup…')} reads a backup file and shows what is in it, with a count for each part, before anything changes. Tick the parts to restore and click ${ui('Restore selected')}.

<h2>Trash</h2>
<p>Invoices deleted from a client's account on the <a href="clients.html#ledger">Clients</a> screen go to the trash for 30 days. In <b>Settings, Backup Management</b>, ${ui('Restore')} brings one back, and ${ui('Delete forever')} removes it and its PDF for good.</p>

  <li><strong>On the old computer</strong>Click ${ui('Export for Move')} in the <a href="control-panel.html">Control Panel</a>, or ${ui('Move to another PC')} in the launcher under ${ui('More options')}.

<p>Any of these installs the newest version:</p>

  <li>${ui('Update Now')} in the <a href="control-panel.html">Control Panel</a>.</li>
  <li>In the launcher, ${ui('More options')}, then ${ui('Update to the latest version')}.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every update first saves a backup of your data in <code>Documents\\FreeGSTBill Backups</code>, then replaces the app. It never touches your data folder or your saved PDFs. It takes about a minute; reload the page when it finishes.</p>
<p>To update by hand instead: download the ZIP, stop the app, extract the ZIP over your app folder replacing the files, and open the launcher again.</p>
<p>If you extract a new ZIP into a different folder by mistake, its launcher does not install a second copy. It shows <b>Already installed on this computer</b>, with the folder, version and number of invoices, and offers ${ui('Update the installed copy')} and ${ui('Open the installed copy')}. The update uses the files in the folder you extracted, so it needs no download and works without internet; your invoices, saved PDFs and trash stay as they are. The new folder can then be deleted.</p>
<p>Updating also removes files that older versions left behind, such as launchers under their old names, once their replacements are in place. Your data, backups and Node.js are never touched.</p>
