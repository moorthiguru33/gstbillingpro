# Known Errors — never let these come back

Every bug reported by a user (GitHub issue, WhatsApp screenshot, email)
gets an entry here **the moment it is diagnosed**, with the rule that
prevents it. Read this file before touching launcher scripts, the
release builder, or PDF/print code.

**Format:** each entry records the *symptom the user saw*, the *real
cause*, the *rule*, and the *automated guard* — if there is no guard,
say so explicitly, because an unguarded rule will be broken again.

## ERR-001 — Non-ASCII characters break every Windows `.ps1`

**Version:** broke in v1.10.46 · fixed in v1.10.47
**Reported by:** @sangwanmail-eng (GitHub issue)

**Symptom**

```
Update — Failed
At ...\_system-scripts\update-windows.ps1:104 char:56
+   Write-Host '  Restart the app (Stop Server �+' Open App) to run the n ...
Unexpected token ')' in expression or statement.
The string is missing the terminator: '.
```

**Cause**

The `.ps1` files were UTF-8 **without a BOM**. Windows PowerShell 5.1
decodes a BOM-less script using the machine's ANSI codepage (cp1252),
*not* UTF-8. So:

| Character | UTF-8 bytes | Decoded as cp1252 | Damage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `→` | `E2 86 92` | `â†'` | `0x92` = `'` (U+2019) |
| `—` | `E2 80 94` | `â€"` | `0x94` = `"` (U+201D) |

PowerShell accepts curly quotes `' ' " "` as **genuine string
delimiters**. So the injected quote terminated the string mid-line.

Two consequences that made this worse than it looked:

1. It is a **parse-time** error — PowerShell compiles the whole file
   before executing a single line. Nothing ran. The update did not
   partially apply.
2. It hit **four** scripts, not just the reported one: `update`
   (line 104), `start` (56), `backup` (36), `move` (40). An em dash is
   only fatal inside a **double**-quoted string; an arrow is fatal in
   both — which is why the breakage looked random.

**Rule**

> Windows launcher scripts (`.ps1`, `.bat`, `.cmd`) must be **pure
> ASCII**. Use `-` not `—`, `...` not `…`, `->` not `→`, `[OK]` not `✅`.

ASCII is the only encoding every Windows codepage agrees on. A UTF-8
BOM would also fix the parse, but ASCII additionally survives users on
non-Latin locales (cp1251, cp936, cp1252) where a BOM alone still
renders mojibake.

**Guard:** `scripts/build-release-zip.mjs` → `assertAsciiOnly()` fails
`npm run release:zip` and prints the offending `file:line`.

**Verify manually:**

```powershell
Get-ChildItem release-templates\_system-scripts\*.ps1 | ForEach-Object {
  $errs = $null
  [void][System.Management.Automation.Language.Parser]::ParseFile($_.FullName, [ref]$null, [ref]$errs)
  "{0,-24} {1}" -f $_.Name, $(if ($errs.Count) { "BROKEN line $($errs[0].Extent.StartLineNumber)" } else { "ok" })
}
```

Must run under **`powershell.exe` (5.1)**, not `pwsh` (7+). PowerShell 7
defaults to UTF-8 and will happily parse a file that 5.1 rejects, so
testing in `pwsh` gives a false pass.

---

## ERR-002 — HTML/HTA with no declared charset renders mojibake

**Version:** fixed in v1.10.47 (found while fixing ERR-001)

**Symptom:** launcher window shows `â€"` and garbled button icons
instead of `—` and emoji.

**Cause:** `Free GST Billing.hta` declared no charset, so MSHTML fell
back to the system codepage.

**Rule**

> Any `.hta` / `.html` file shipped to users declares its charset in the
> first 1024 bytes, as the first tag inside `<head>`:
> `<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />`

Use the `http-equiv` form, not bare `<meta charset>` — HTA runs on
MSHTML and the long form is the reliable one there.

**Note:** this is the *opposite* fix from ERR-001. HTML can declare its
encoding, so keep the nice typography; PowerShell cannot be trusted to,
so strip to ASCII. Do not "fix" the HTA by stripping its emoji.

**Guard:** none — HTA is not covered by `assertAsciiOnly()`. Check by
eye when editing the launcher.

## ERR-003 — Uploading a new ZIP onto an old release tag

**Version:** affected v1.10.45 and v1.10.46 · corrected at v1.10.47

**Symptom:** the Releases page showed `Free-GST-Billing-v1.10.46.zip`
attached to a release titled **v1.10.44**, with mismatched dates (asset
"13 hours ago", source code "4 days ago"). No v1.10.45 or v1.10.46
release ever existed.

**Cause:** new builds were uploaded as assets onto the existing v1.10.44
release instead of cutting a new tagged release.

Two real consequences:

1. The in-app updater reads
   `GET /repos/.../releases/latest` and shows the user `tag_name`. That
   returned `v1.10.44` no matter which build was actually attached, so
   every user was told the wrong version number.
2. Anyone landing on the old release page downloads whatever ZIP is
   pinned there — which is how a build that was already known-broken
   stayed publicly downloadable after the fix shipped.

**Rule**

> Every shipped build gets its **own** tagged release matching
> `package.json`. Never re-upload an asset onto a previous tag.

```
npm run release:zip
gh release create v<VERSION> "release-build/Free-GST-Billing-v<VERSION>.zip" --target main
```

Then confirm what the updater will actually see:

```
gh api repos/IamRamgarhia/Free-GST-Billing-Software/releases/latest \
  --jq '{tag: .tag_name, asset: .assets[0].name}'
```

The tag and the asset filename must both match the new version.

**Guard:** none — this is release procedure, not code. Run the
verification command above after every publish.

**Also:** `gh` may have more than one account in its keyring. If
`gh release create` fails with *"workflow scope may be required"*, the
active account is probably the wrong one — check `gh auth status` and
`gh auth switch -h github.com -u IamRamgarhia`. The error message is
misleading; it is a permissions problem, not a scope problem.

## ERR-004 — CSP `frame-src` blocked the print iframe

**Version:** fixed in v1.10.48
**Reported by:** @sangwanmail-eng (console screenshot, Firefox)

**Symptom**

```
Content-Security-Policy: The page's settings blocked the loading of a
resource (frame-src) at blob:http://localhost:47371/993b6dbb-... because
it violates the following directive: "frame-src https://accounts.google.com"
```

Print and Save-as-PDF silently did nothing.

**Cause**

`printViaIframe()` does `URL.createObjectURL(blob)` → `frame.src = url`,
but the CSP `frame-src` allowed only `https://accounts.google.com`. The
iframe was blocked outright.

Why it went unnoticed to v1.10.46: **Firefox enforces `frame-src` against
`blob:` strictly; Chrome has been laxer with blob-URL frames.** Testing
only in Chrome hides this entire class of bug.

**Rule**

> Every CSP directive that a `blob:` URL can be fetched under must list
> `blob:` explicitly. Today: `worker-src` (Tesseract), `img-src`,
> `frame-src` (PDF print). A directive with an explicit value does **not**
> inherit `default-src`.

**Guard:** none automated. When adding any `createObjectURL` usage, check
which CSP directive governs the sink and confirm it lists `blob:`.

**Test in Firefox, not just Chrome** — see also ERR-005.

## ERR-005 — `transform: scale()` does not shrink the layout box

**Version:** fixed in v1.10.48
**Reported by:** @sangwanmail-eng

**Symptom:** "live preview show full when browser zoom on 50%" — at normal
zoom the invoice preview was clipped on the **left**, and no amount of
scrolling reached it.

**Cause**

`.preview-scaler` used `transform: scale(z)`. Transforms change what is
painted, never the element's layout box, so the preview kept reserving
`.invoice-preview-container`'s hard `width: 210mm` (≈794px) at every zoom
level. Two things then compounded:

1. On a pane narrower than 794px the sheet overflowed horizontally.
2. `.preview-pane` used `align-items: center`. **Centring an overflowing
   child in a scroll container pushes its leading edge into negative
   scroll space, which is unreachable.** Hence the left side was gone for
   good, not merely off-screen.

Dropping the browser to 50% zoom "fixed" it only because that doubles the
viewport in CSS pixels, clearing the 794px threshold.

**This is why it did not reproduce for the maintainer:** the bug is a pure
function of preview-pane width. Invisible on a wide monitor, guaranteed on
a 1366px laptop.

**Rule**

> When scaling with `transform`, an ancestor must reserve
> `natural size × scale`, or the layout will not match what is painted.
> In a scroll container use `align-items: safe center`, never bare
> `center` — `safe` degrades to start-alignment on overflow instead of
> hiding the leading edge.

**Guard:** none automated. **Check new layout work at 1366×768**, not only
at your monitor's width.

## ERR-006 — Missing custom paper width silently becomes 80mm thermal

**Version:** fixed in v1.10.48

**Symptom (suspected):** "live preview show normal template, but pdf save
as thermal printer."

**Cause**

`getPaperSize()` reads a missing `customPaperWidth` as `80`, and
`kind = w < 100 ? 'thermal' : 'sheet'` — so absent width means **thermal**.
Meanwhile the client-preference writer saved only `preferredPaperSize`,
not the dimensions. A client stored on `custom` therefore came back as
`custom` *with no width* → silently an 80mm receipt.

**Rule**

> A setting whose meaning depends on companion fields must persist those
> fields together. Never let a missing dimension fall through to a default
> that changes the **kind** of output.

**Guard:** none automated.

**Status:** the code defect is real and fixed, but it is **probably not**
what the reporter hit — see ERR-007, which reproduces their symptom
exactly. Keep this fix; treat ERR-007 as the real cause.

---

## ERR-007 — CSP `'self'` does not resolve inside an `about:blank` iframe, so PDFs rendered unstyled

**Version:** fixed in v1.10.48
**Reported by:** @sangwanmail-eng — "live preview show normal template, but
pdf save as thermal printer"

**Symptom:** the on-screen preview looks correct, but the saved PDF comes
out as cramped plain text in a narrow column with no colours, borders or
table rules. It *reads* as a thermal receipt. **It is not thermal — it is
the invoice with no CSS.**

**Cause**

`html2canvas` clones the invoice into an **`about:blank` iframe** before
rasterising it (confirmed by instrumenting `document.createElement`: one
iframe, empty `src`, no `srcdoc`). Firefox inherits the parent CSP into
that iframe but resolves `'self'` against `about:blank`'s **null origin**,
so `'self'` matches nothing and the app's own stylesheet is refused:

```
Content-Security-Policy: blocked a style (style-src-elem) at
http://localhost:47415/assets/index-*.css ... violates the following
directive: "style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com"
```

**Chrome resolves `'self'` to the inherited origin, so it never fails
there.** This is the second bug in one report caused by Chrome-only
testing (see ERR-004).

**Rule**

> Do not rely on `'self'` for resources that a *cloned or inherited*
> document will request — `about:blank`, `srcdoc` and `blob:` documents
> may carry a null origin where `'self'` matches nothing. Name the real
> origin. `connect-src` already lists `http://localhost:*` for a
> comparable reason.

**Guard:** none automated.

**How it was proved** (repeat this for any "renders differently in the PDF"
report — file size is a reliable proxy for lost styling):

| | PDF bytes | CSP violations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| before fix, CSP present | 421,048 | 1 |
| before fix, CSP stripped | 452,389 | 0 |
| after fix, CSP present | 452,551 | 0 |
| after fix, CSP stripped | 452,173 | 0 |

A 31 KB gap that closes to noise once fixed. Strip the CSP meta with a
Playwright `route` interception to get the baseline.

## ERR-008 — `<datalist>` options showed GSTINs instead of supplier names

**Version:** broke in v1.10.50 · fixed in v1.10.52
**Reported by:** @sangwanmail-eng (#40)

**Symptom:** "it shows gst numbers list instead of supplier name list in
supplier text box."

**Cause**

The supplier suggestion list put the GSTIN in the option's **child text**,
intending it as a secondary hint:

```jsx
<option value={s.name}>{`GSTIN ${s.gstin}`}</option>   // WRONG
```

Browsers disagree about which part of a datalist option they display:

| Browser | Shows |
| --- | --- |
| Chrome / Edge | the **value**, with label/text as secondary grey text |
| Firefox | the **label or text INSTEAD of the value** |

So Firefox users got a list of GST numbers where supplier names belonged.

**Rule**

> A `<datalist>` `<option>` carries a **`value` and nothing else** — no
> child text, no `label` attribute — unless the label has been checked in
> both Chrome and Firefox. There is no portable way to attach a secondary
> hint.

**Guard:** none automated.

### The part worth remembering

The v1.10.50 Playwright test **passed**, and would still pass on the
broken build. It asserted on `option.value`, which was correct the whole
time — the defect was in what the browser chose to *display* from that
option.

> **Testing the mechanism is not testing the presentation.** When a bug
> would be visible to a user looking at the screen, the assertion has to
> be on what is rendered, not on the data behind it.

The fixed test asserts on `label ?? textContent ?? value` — the actual
precedence a browser applies — so it fails on the old markup.

## ERR-009 - The release ZIP shipped a server that could not start

**Version:** broke in v1.10.44.1 - fixed in v1.10.63
**Reported by:** @ANIM35H (#54)

**Symptom**

```
  Starting server on port 47371...
  Server did not respond in 15s. Check for errors in this window.
```

The launcher never showed the real error. Running the shipped `server.js`
by hand gives it:

```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '_system/src/utils.js'
  imported from '_system/server.js'
```

**Cause**

`server.js` has imported `./src/utils.js` (for `computeInvoiceTotals`)
since v1.10.31. Commit `4169fac` then removed `src/` from the ZIP to cut
the download from 31.5 MB to 15.95 MB - correct for the React source,
except the **server** had quietly grown a runtime dependency on one file
inside it. The process exits before binding, so the launcher can only
report a timeout.

**Every release from v1.10.44.1 onward shipped a dead server.**

**Rule**

> Anything `server.js` imports must be in the ZIP. Slimming the package is
> fine; slimming it without re-checking the server's import graph is not.

**Guard:** `scripts/build-release-zip.mjs` -> `assertServerImportsResolve()`
walks every relative import reachable from the packaged `server.js` and
**fails the build** if a file is missing. Verified by removing the fix and
confirming the build aborts.

### The part worth remembering

Fifteen releases went out broken while every check was green. The smoke
suite, the lint run and the manual testing all exercised the **development
tree**, where `src/` is always present. Nothing ever ran the artefact that
users actually download.

> **Testing the repo is not testing the release.** If a defect can exist
> only in the packaged output, it can only be caught by opening the
> package.

It stayed hidden longer because the README pointed people at the *source*
ZIP, which does contain `src/` - so the users who complained loudest about
other things had working servers, and the only broken path was the one
almost nobody took. Correcting the README in v1.10.61 pointed everyone at
the release ZIP, which would have made this far more visible.


### Two further faults found the moment the gate was built

Running the suite against a genuinely fresh install exposed defects the
tests themselves had been hiding:

1. **The first-run wizard had never been exercised.** A fresh install shows
   two screens in sequence whose buttons are capitalised differently -
   `Skip Setup` then `Skip setup`. The suite matched `/^Skip setup$/`, which
   never matched the first one. In the dev tree onboarding is already
   complete, so no wizard appears and the mismatch was invisible.

2. **The "is anything in the way?" check was wrong.** It used
   `offsetParent !== null`, which is **always null for a `position: fixed`
   element** - and `.modal-overlay` is fixed. So it reported a clear screen
   while a full-page wizard sat on top, and every later click timed out
   against an intercepted element.

Both are the same mistake as ERR-009 wearing a different hat: the primed
development environment is not the one users get.

**Verify by hand after any packaging change:**

```powershell
Expand-Archive Free-GST-Billing-vX.Y.Z.zip -DestinationPath t
cd t\Free-GST-Billing\_system
npm install --omit=dev
node server.js        # must print "running at http://localhost:PORT"
```

## ERR-010 - Scoping one record type per business left every other total mixed

**Version:** incomplete in v1.10.64 / v1.10.65 · fixed in v1.10.66
**Reported by:** @sangwanmail-eng (#64)

**Symptom** - *"still payment receipt and reports show all companies data"*;
*"Why total invoiced, tax collected, outstanding and invoices show all companies
data?"*; *"expenses, reports, receipts, purchases and recurring not refresh when
company switch"*. Screenshots: dashboard header "0 invoices" beside a card
reading "Invoices 1 / ₹187.62"; Reports "Revenue ₹0.00, Expenses ₹560.00".

**Cause** - v1.10.64 filtered *invoices* by business, but each screen loads
several collections. GST Returns, Reports and Income Tax passed expenses and
purchases through unfiltered, so GSTR-3B input tax credit mixed GSTINs. The
dashboard summed its cards from the raw server response before filtering.
Receipts were never scoped. And seven screens read the business once on mount,
so after a switch they showed the old company and stamped new records with it.

**Rule** - when a record type becomes per-business, check **every** `getAll*()`
call site, not just the list screen. Derive totals from the filtered list, never
from the raw response. A screen that reads the active business must re-read it
when the business changes - App keys those screens on `businessKey`.

**Guard** - `tests/smoke.mjs` (#64 checks): dashboard, Reports and GSTR-3B ITC
values must **not** move when another company's invoice / expense / purchase is
added, and **must** move when this company's is, so a dead card cannot pass.
Switching company must refresh an open Expenses screen and stamp a new expense
with the new business; another company's receipts must be hidden.

## ERR-011 - The invoice re-decided what the tax engine had already decided

**Version:** fixed in v1.10.66
**Reported by:** @Yashparmar1125 (#61)

**Symptom** - *"the itemized `IGST (18%)` line displays as `₹0.00`"* while the
grand total is correct.

**Cause** - `computeInvoiceTotals` decides interstate from GST state **codes**
(place of supply, client GSTIN). `InvoicePreview` and GST Returns'
`billIsInterstate` each decided it again from state **names**. They disagreed for
a client from another state supplied in the seller's state, so the invoice
printed an IGST row holding `totals.igst = 0`. Separately the engine treated a
client abroad as intrastate, because a foreign state has no GST code.

**Rule** - whatever *displays or reports* tax uses the flags the engine returned
with the amounts (`totals.isInterstate`), never a parallel calculation. Place of
supply follows the client's country and state - never the currency, which is
what PR #60 got wrong.

Changing a tax decision moves it everywhere it is reported: exports then had to
leave GSTR-1 B2B / B2C (an inter-state row with the home state as place of
supply is rejected) and enter GSTR-3B 3.1(b), and the invoice form's totals
`useMemo` had to list `client.country`, or switching only the country kept the
old split on screen and Save stored it.

**Guard** - `scripts/tax-test.mjs` `[V66-#61]` (place of supply governs, GSTIN
only, export, same-state USD); smoke: a Delhi client supplied in Punjab must
print CGST / SGST and no IGST row.

## ERR-012 - A print fix that only reached the PDF path

**Version:** fixed in v1.10.66
**Reported by:** @sangwanmail-eng (#64, photo of a printed proforma)

**Symptom** - *"Some text not visible in black and white print."* The photo shows
"This is not a tax invoice. For estimation purposes only." almost invisible.

**Cause** - the text was inline `#94a3b8`, a 2.6:1 contrast. The `.printing-mode`
CSS darkens such colours, but only the html2canvas PDF path adds that class; the
**Print** button prints an iframe that never gets it.

**Rule** - fix colours at the source so screen, Print and PDF are all legible.
Invoice text must reach 4.5:1 against its background. Never rely on a mode class
that only one output path applies.

**Guard** - smoke: every text element of a proforma preview must reach 4.5:1.

---

## ERR-013 - CSV exports wrote formula-like text raw

**Version:** fixed in v1.10.66
**Reported by:** @Yashparmar1125 (#63)

**Symptom** - a cell such as `=HYPERLINK("http://…","Invoice")` in an exported CSV
runs as a formula in Excel or Google Sheets.

**Cause** - three local `escape` helpers quoted commas and quotes only - two of
them not even line breaks.

**Rule** - every CSV cell goes through `toCsvCell` / `toCsvLine` in
`src/utils.js`. No local escape functions.

**Guard** - `scripts/csv-test.mjs`, part of `npm run test:unit`.

## ERR-014 - The ZIP only unpacked cleanly on Windows, and Linux had no updater

**Version:** every Windows-built release up to v1.10.65 · fixed in v1.10.66
**Reported by:** @deppen12 (#59)

**Symptom** - *"it's very difficult to install on nas"*; *"now today you roll out
new update now my works start again coz update for button not works."*

**Cause** - Windows PowerShell 5.1's `Compress-Archive` writes `\` as the path
separator (73 entries in v1.10.65). The ZIP format allows only `/`, so Linux,
macOS and BusyBox unzip either warn or create single files named
`Free-GST-Billing\_system\server.js`. And the Control Panel's Update looked for
`update-unix.sh`, which never existed, so it always answered "Script not found
for this platform".

**Rule** - build ZIPs with `tar.exe -a` (or `zip`), never `Compress-Archive`.
Every Control Panel action offered on Unix needs a Unix script, written for
POSIX `sh` - NAS images have no bash. Test Unix scripts in a real Linux
container, not by reading them.

Two traps found while testing the fix, not by reading it: BusyBox `unzip` exits
with status 1 for real errors (full disk, damaged file) as well as for the
warnings Info-ZIP uses 1 for, so the updater requires status 0 and then checks
every extracted file's size against the ZIP's own directory. And choosing `sh`
for *every* Unix script broke `backup-unix.sh`, which needs bash - only the
updater runs under `sh`.

**Guard** - `scripts/build-release-zip.mjs` reads the finished archive back and
fails on any `\` path or on a `.sh` with CRLF endings. `npm run test:update-unix`
runs the updater in Alpine (BusyBox, no bash) and Debian slim (dash): a real
update, a re-run, rollback after a failed `npm install`, a truncated download,
no downgrade over a newer install, a git checkout, a system with no unzip, and a
full update under dash.

## ERR-015 - "Add New Profile" blanked the form and called it a new company

**Version:** broke when multi-business landed · fixed in v1.10.67
**Reported by:** @sangwanmail-eng (#66 item 3)

**Symptom** - *"when adding a new company, the newly added company profile
replaces the existing company profile. This issue is particularly noticeable
when using the software for the first time."* Plus an unsaved-changes bar for a
form the user had not touched.

**Cause** - `handleAddNewProfile` only called `setProfile({ ...blank })`. The
active profile file still held the old company, so the next **Save Profile**
overwrote it. On a first install that company had never been copied into
`data/profiles/`, so there was no surviving copy anywhere. The blank form also
differed from the saved baseline, which is what raised the unsaved-changes bar.

**Rule** - a "start a new X" button must persist the current X before it clears
the form, and reset the dirty baseline afterwards. Clearing a form is not the
same as creating a record, and the active profile is a single file, not a list.

**Guard** - `tests/smoke.mjs` (#66): after Add New Profile the previous company
is present in Business Profiles and the form is not marked dirty.

## ERR-016 - Every document type counted as turnover

**Version:** fixed in v1.10.67
**Reported by:** @sangwanmail-eng (#66 item 7)

**Symptom** - *"Why are documents such as Proforma/Estimate, Delivery Challan,
Composition, Credit Note and Bill of Supply included in the Total Invoiced
Amount?"* A screenshot showed ₹4,248 of "sales" where ₹1,239 was an estimate.

**Cause** - the dashboard cards summed every bill row. `invoiceType` was only
ever used for labels and numbering, never for deciding what is turnover.

**Rule** - money questions go through one rule, not per-screen filters:
`salesSign()` in `src/utils.js` returns +1 for a sale (tax invoice, bill of
supply, composition), -1 for a credit note and 0 for quotes, challans and
anything cancelled. Every new money figure uses it.

**Guard** - `scripts/tax-test.mjs` `[V67-#66]` covers all eight cases; the smoke
suite checks a proforma and a challan do not move Total Invoiced while a sale
and a credit note do.

## ERR-017 - Launcher said "_system folder is missing" while Explorer showed it

**Version:** shipped with the one-launcher layout in v1.10.44 · explained in v1.10.69
**Reported by:** the maintainer, with a photo of the screen (2026-09-23)

**Symptom** - the launcher opens and says *"`_system` folder is missing - Please
re-extract the ZIP or re-download from GitHub Releases"*, while the Explorer
window right behind it is listing `_system` in the very folder the user just
double-clicked in. It reads as a broken download.

**Cause** - Windows lets you double-click a file **inside** a ZIP without
extracting anything. It copies that one file to
`%TEMP%\Temp1_<name>.zip\<inner folder>\` and runs it from there, with no
siblings. The launcher was reporting the truth about the temp folder it had
been copied into; the folder the user was looking at was a different one. The
message named a cause ("re-extract") without ever naming the folder it had
checked, so there was no way to tell the two apart.

**Rule** - when a program reports that a file is missing, it names the folder it
looked in. A path the user can compare against what is on screen ends the
argument in one glance; "a file is missing" starts it.

**Guard** - the launcher now detects a `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp\` location and says
so in its own words ("Windows opened this file straight out of the ZIP"), with
numbered steps and a button that opens the Downloads folder. Any other missing
`_system` prints the folder it checked. Verified by running the launcher from a
simulated `Temp1_*.zip` folder and screenshotting both states; there is no
automated check, because nothing can drive `mshta` headlessly.

## ERR-018 - "Open App" never opened the browser, on any machine

**Version:** broke in v1.10.44, when the HTA launcher replaced the .bat files · fixed in v1.10.69
**Reported by:** found by installing the real release ZIP end to end (2026-09-23)

**Symptom** - the installer finishes, the server starts, and the console then
says *"Server did not respond in 15s. Check for errors in this window."* The
browser never opens. The app is running the whole time: paste the address in
by hand and it answers immediately.

**Cause** - `start-windows.ps1` decided whether the server was up with
`Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:$p/api/profile -TimeoutSec 1`. Windows
PowerShell 5.1 runs the system proxy auto-detect (WPAD) on every web request,
including requests to `127.0.0.1`, and that costs about two seconds on a
machine with a proxy, a VPN or a corporate network. With a one-second timeout
the check could never return true - measured on a real install: `-TimeoutSec 1`
always times out, `-TimeoutSec 10` succeeds in 2.07s, and the same request with
`DefaultWebProxy = $null` succeeds in **0.03s**. Meanwhile the server itself was
accepting TCP connections 0.6 seconds after launch. So the script also believed
no server was running when one was, and started a second copy every time.

**Rule** - a loopback health check sets `[System.Net.WebRequest]::DefaultWebProxy
= $null` and addresses `127.0.0.1`, never `localhost` behind a system proxy.
And a timeout is a bound on how long the *other* end may take, never a bet on
how fast the local HTTP stack starts: give it seconds, not one second.

**Rule (second)** - a packaged installer is tested by installing the package.
The release gate boots `server.js` with node directly, which is why it passed
65 checks a release while the thing every Windows user actually double-clicks
was broken. Run the real `install-windows.ps1` from a real extracted ZIP
before shipping a release that touches the launcher or the scripts.

**Guard** - none automated (it needs a real Windows desktop session and a
browser). Verified by hand: extract the ZIP, run `_system\install-windows.ps1`,
and confirm the browser opens on `http://localhost:47371` with no warning.

## ERR-043 - Refreshing the page while editing an invoice blanked the app

**Version:** since v1.5.0 · fixed in v1.10.76
**Reported by:** found while testing the #80 fix

**Symptom** - press F5 (or the browser restores the tab) while an invoice is
open for editing, and the whole app goes blank.

**Cause** - the invoice template read `profile.swift` for the bank block. On
a refresh the business profile is still loading on the first render, so
`profile` was null, and an error while rendering unmounts the whole app.

**Rule** - a component that can render before its data arrives treats the
missing data as empty, never as an object that is certainly there.

**Guard** - InvoicePreview uses `profile || {}`; the smoke check
"refreshing the page while editing an invoice keeps the app on screen".

## ERR-042 - With "Prices include tax", Subtotal + tax did not equal the Total

**Version:** since prices-include-tax was added · fixed in v1.10.76
**Reported by:** @sangwanmail-eng (#83)

**Symptom** - a ₹300 line at 0% and two ₹1,050 items at 18%, prices including
tax: Subtotal ₹2,400, CGST ₹160.17, SGST ₹160.17, Total ₹2,400.

**Cause** - the templates printed `totals.subtotal`, which with inclusive
prices is the gross INCLUDING tax. The tax and total were right.

**Rule** - a printed breakdown must add up on paper. With inclusive prices the
Subtotal printed is the taxable value (before discount).

**Guard** - `printedSubtotal()` in utils.js, used by every template and the
WhatsApp text; tax-test "[V76] #83 printed Subtotal".

## ERR-041 - Purchase from another state not marked inter-state

**Version:** · fixed in v1.10.76
**Reported by:** @raviagrawal01 (#82)

**Symptom** - a supplier GSTIN from another state left "Inter-state purchase"
unticked, so the credit landed under CGST + SGST in GSTR-3B Table 4.

**Cause** - the box was manual only, unlike sales invoices, which work it out.

**Rule** - anything the GSTIN already tells us is filled in for the user, and
left editable.

**Guard** - `isInterstateSupply()`; tax-test "[V76] #82".

---

## ERR-040 - GSTR-3B Table 6 did not set CGST/SGST credit off against IGST

**Version:** · fixed in v1.10.76
**Reported by:** @raviagrawal01 (#81)

**Symptom** - CGST ₹360 + SGST ₹360 credit, IGST ₹810 liability: Net Tax
Payable ₹810. The law gives ₹90.

**Cause** - each head was reduced only by its own credit.

**Rule** - credit is set off in the legal order (Section 49(5), 49A,
Rule 88A): IGST credit against IGST, then CGST, then SGST; CGST credit
against CGST, then IGST; SGST credit against SGST, then IGST. Never CGST
against SGST or the reverse.

**Guard** - `setOffITC()`; tax-test "[V76] #81".

## ERR-039 - Stock ignored edits, and quotations took stock out

**Version:** since stock tracking · fixed in v1.10.76
**Reported by:** @raviagrawal01 (#80)

**Symptom** - changing a saved invoice's quantity 10 -> 15 left stock at 40
(expected 35). Quotations and proformas took stock out; converting one then
took it out again; credit notes took stock out instead of putting it back.

**Cause** - stock was moved once, on a bill's first save, by -quantity for
every type, and never again (`stockDeducted` was true for any existing bill).

**Rule** - every bill keeps a record of what it has done to stock
(`data.stockApplied`), and each save applies only the difference to what it
should do now (sales -qty, credit note +qty, quote/proforma/cancelled 0).
Bills from before have no record and are taken to have done what the old
code did: -quantity for every type (0 if cancelled or made by the recurring
generator). The old code only moved stock on a bill's FIRST save, so an old
bill whose quantity was edited later is taken to hold its current quantity,
not its first one; that difference cannot be recovered and is accepted.
Every save works from the server's copy of the bill (not the editor's), saves
run one at a time, and a conversion takes over the original's record.

**Guard** - `stockEffect` / `appliedStock` / `stockDelta`; tax-test "[V76]
#80"; smoke checks "v76 #80 ...".

## ERR-038 - A new ZIP installed a second copy; updates left old files behind

**Version:** since v1.10.44 (one-file launcher) · fixed in v1.10.75
**Reported by:** the maintainer, on their own PC

**Symptom** - after downloading a new version, the PC had two Free GST
Billing apps (`Downloads\Free-GST-Billing-v1.10.68` and `...-v1.10.74`), each
with its own invoices. The shortcuts moved to the new, empty one, so the
invoices seemed to be gone. Separately, installs that started on an older
version still had launchers and scripts under their old names, which also
look like a second copy.

**Cause** - every release ZIP extracts to a new versioned folder, and the
launcher there saw "not installed in THIS folder" and offered Install, which
made a second, complete install and repointed the shortcuts. The updater only
ever copied files in; nothing removed the files a release renamed or retired.

**Rule** - an installer looks for an existing install (the Desktop and
Start-Menu shortcuts say where it is, plus the one-command install folder)
before it installs, and sends the user to Update when it finds one. A release
that renames or retires a file also deletes the old one on the next start -
by exact name, only when its replacement is present, never inside `data`,
`node`, `node_modules` or backups.

**Guard** - `install-windows.ps1`, `install.ps1` and the launcher all stop
with "Already installed in <folder>" (FREEGSTBILL_DIR still allows a
deliberate second copy). `start-windows.ps1` / `start-unix.sh` remove the
known obsolete files. Verified by hand on this PC: from a new folder the
check finds the real install (v1.10.74, 2 invoices) and ignores its own.

## ERR-037 - GSTR-3B counted exports twice; HSN summary added credit notes

**Version:** broke before v1.10.67 · fixed in v1.10.74
**Reported by:** found while documenting the GST Returns screen

**Symptom** - an export to a client without a GSTIN appeared in the B2C
table and in 3.1(a) as well as 3.1(b), and its IGST was added to output tax
twice. Credit notes raised the HSN summary instead of lowering it.

**Cause** - `b2cBills` in GSTReturns.jsx was "every bill with no client
GSTIN", which includes exports and credit notes; the HSN aggregation added
every line with a + sign.

**Rule** - every return table starts from one classification: exports,
B2B, B2C and credit notes are disjoint sets, and a credit note always carries
sign -1 wherever it is summed.

**Guard** - none automated yet (GSTReturns has no unit-testable totals
function). By hand: one export without GSTIN must appear only in 3.1(b).

---

## ERR-036 - "Needs a Quick Start" appeared while the app was running

**Version:** since the continuous server check · fixed in v1.10.73
**Reported by:** found by the release test on a machine at 100% CPU

**Symptom** - mid-session, the whole app was replaced by "Free GST Billing
Software Needs a Quick Start ... Starting..." although the server was running
and answered in milliseconds a moment later.

**Cause** - `App.jsx` polls `/api/profile` every 5 s with a 3 s timeout, and a
single slow reply set `serverDown`, which swaps the whole app for the notice.
On a loaded PC one reply can take longer than 3 s.

**Rule** - a liveness check that can take the whole screen away needs more
than one failure: judge "down" on consecutive misses, and only trust a single
miss before the app has ever loaded.

**Guard** - none automated (needs a controlled slow server). By hand: pause
the server process for ~6 s mid-session; the app must stay on screen.

---

## ERR-035 - Control Panel: "Launcher scripts not detected" on every install

**Version:** broke in v1.10.44 (Control Panel) and v1.10.69 (Update Now uses it) · fixed in v1.10.72
**Reported by:** @deppen12 (GitHub #73)

**Symptom**

```
Launcher scripts not detected. This app appears to be running from a dev clone
(npm start) rather than an installer ZIP. Update / Backup / Restore / Move
buttons need the launcher scripts under _system-scripts/.
```

Every button behind it answered `Script not found for this platform`,
including Update Now in Settings and the sidebar.

**Cause** - `scripts/build-release-zip.mjs` has always FLATTENED
`release-templates/_system-scripts/*` into `_system/`, next to `server.js`.
`server.js` looked only for folders named `_system-scripts` (inside
`_system`, in `release-templates`, and beside `_system`). None of them exists
in a ZIP install, so the lookup found nothing. The release test never touched
the Control Panel, so no check noticed.

**Rule** - when the packager moves a file, every path that reads it moves in
the same change. A folder is chosen because it contains the file needed, never
because a folder of that name exists.

**Guard** - `tests/smoke.mjs` "#73 the Control Panel finds its update and
backup scripts" (and, on Windows, all five). `verify-release.mjs` runs the
suite on a fresh install of the ZIP, so the real layout is what is tested.
Verified red: the v1.10.70 ZIP install reports `controlScriptsAvailable: false`.

## ERR-034 - Settings: the save bar sat on top of the "Jump to" bar

**Version:** broke in v1.10.67 · fixed in v1.10.71
**Reported by:** found while taking documentation screenshots

**Symptom** - once Settings was scrolled, the "Jump to" section buttons were
hidden behind the "Everything is saved" bar and could not be clicked.

**Cause** - both bars were `position: sticky; top: 0`. The save bar was made
always-visible in v1.10.67 without moving the jump bar down.

**Rule** - two sticky elements in one scroll area need stacked `top` offsets,
and the lower one's offset must follow the upper one's real height (it wraps
on narrow screens).

**Guard** - none automated. By hand: open Settings, scroll down, check the
jump bar sits below the save bar, and a jump lands below both.

---

## ERR-033 - Setup wizard: the chosen language reverted to English

**Version:** broke in v1.10.6 · fixed in v1.10.71
**Reported by:** found while writing the documentation

**Symptom** - picking Hindi (or Tamil, Marathi, Bengali) with the Retail,
Freelancer, Wholesale or Service business type gave English labels. The
paper size picked in the wizard changed nothing either.

**Cause** - `finish()` set `labelLanguage` first, then applied the business
preset, and four presets set `labelLanguage: 'en'`. The paper size was saved
to print settings, which the invoice screen never reads: it reads the invoice
defaults.

**Rule** - apply presets first and the user's explicit choices after, so the
explicit choice wins. Save a setting where the screen that uses it reads it.

**Guard** - none automated. By hand: run the wizard with Retail + Hindi + 80mm,
then open a new invoice.

## ERR-032 - Income tax: labels and PDF disagreed with the tax worked out

**Version:** broke in v1.10.31 · fixed in v1.10.71
**Reported by:** found while writing the documentation

**Symptom** - the screen said STCG 15% and LTCG 10% over ₹1L, the engine used
20% and 12.5% over ₹1.25L. The 80D hint said ₹1,00,000; the tax used ₹50,000,
and the ITR-4 PDF printed up to ₹1 lakh. Business income added GST, quotes,
challans and foreign-currency invoices to sales. "Office rent" in a bank
statement became rent received. Pushing a statement twice doubled it.

**Cause** - the engine rates and limits were updated, the labels were not; the
UI never passed age, so senior limits could not apply; sales used
`totalAmount` of every non-cancelled bill; the rent-paid rule came after the
rent rule, and the first match wins.

**Rule** - labels quote the engine's values, never their own copies. Income is
counted from real sales without GST (`salesSign`).

**Guard** - `scripts/tax-test.mjs` [V71] income-tax block: office rent is an
expense, and the ITR-4 80D line equals the limit the tax used.

---

## ERR-031 - Reports counted quotes and challans as sales, credit notes as income

**Version:** broke before v1.10.67 · fixed in v1.10.71
**Reported by:** found while writing the documentation

**Symptom** - Reports' revenue did not match the Dashboard's. Proforma
estimates and delivery challans counted as revenue and as money owed; credit
notes were ADDED to revenue.

**Cause** - v1.10.67 introduced `salesSign()` for the Dashboard; Reports kept
summing every non-cancelled bill.

**Rule** - every total of "sales" goes through `salesSign()` / `countsAsSales()`.
Never sum `totalAmount` over all bills.

**Guard** - none in the smoke suite yet; `salesSign` itself is covered in
`scripts/tax-test.mjs`. By hand: a proforma must not change Reports.

---

## ERR-030 - GST rates and the B2C Large limit were out of date

**Version:** stale from Aug 2024 / Sep 2025 · fixed in v1.10.71
**Reported by:** found while writing the documentation

**Symptom** - the GSTR-1 export blocked any item at 40% ("Portal accepts only
0, 0.25, 3, 5, 12, 18, 28%"), no screen offered 40%, and B2C Large started at
₹2.5 lakh.

**Cause** - hard-coded lists from before GST 2.0 (40% from 22 Sep 2025) and
before Notification 12/2024-CT (B2CL above ₹1 lakh from 1 Aug 2024). Adding
40% also broke the "second-highest rate" default for new rows, which would
have become 28%.

**Rule** - GST rates and limits live in one place in `utils.js`
(`GST_PORTAL_RATES`, `b2clThreshold`), with the date a change took effect.
Defaults name the rate (18%), never a position in a list.

**Guard** - `scripts/tax-test.mjs` [V71] rates block.

---

## ERR-029 - TDS / TCS came out as ₹0 on ordinary invoices

**Version:** broke in v1.10.31 · fixed in v1.10.71
**Reported by:** found while writing the documentation

**Symptom** - ticking TDS (194J at 10%, say) or TCS on an invoice under ₹50
lakh gave 0.

**Cause** - the ₹50 lakh threshold was applied to every section, but it belongs
to 194Q and 206C(1H) only. And the client's running total for the year was
never worked out: the invoice screen always passed 0.

**Rule** - thresholds belong to a section, not to TDS/TCS as a whole. A
per-client yearly total is worked out from saved invoices
(`clientYearToDate`), by the invoice screen and the server alike.

**Guard** - `scripts/tax-test.mjs` [V71] TDS/TCS and year-to-date blocks.

---

## ERR-028 - Recurring templates lost their settings when edited

**Version:** broke in v1.10.31 · fixed in v1.10.71
**Reported by:** found while writing the documentation

**Symptom** - editing a template made from an invoice wiped its "every N",
end date or count, terms, options and business. "Generate Now" made invoices
with no CGST/SGST/IGST split, ignored the interval and end, and never counted.
A template with no on/off flag showed Active but never fired. Auto-fired
invoices in Jan-Mar carried next year's financial-year label.

**Cause** - the server replaces the whole record on save and the form only
sent the fields it shows; Generate Now had its own simplified maths in the
browser; the server checked `!tpl.active` and used the calendar year.

**Rule** - an edit form spreads the full original record under its own
fields. One code path makes recurring invoices: the server's
`generateFromTemplate`, used by the daily run and by Generate Now.

**Guard** - `tests/smoke.mjs` "v71 Generate Now" checks: works on a paused
template, splits the tax, honours every-2-months, counts the invoice.

---

## ERR-027 - Deleting a purchase bill did not take its stock back out

**Version:** broke in v1.10.50 · fixed in v1.10.71
**Reported by:** found while writing the documentation

**Symptom** - the confirmation said "Stock levels for the products in this
bill will be reverted", but stock stayed. Removing a row while editing a bill
also left its stock in.

**Cause** - delete only removed the file; the edit path only looked at rows
still present.

**Rule** - every path that adds stock has a matching path that removes it:
save, edit (changed and removed rows) and delete.

**Guard** - none automated. By hand: add a purchase of 5, delete it, check
stock.

---

## ERR-026 - Print did not save; Save & Download could print an unsaved number

**Version:** broke in v1.10.58 · fixed in v1.10.71
**Reported by:** found while writing the documentation

**Symptom** - Print handed the client a numbered invoice that was never saved.
Save & Download built the PDF before the number was reserved, so the PDF
could show a different number from the saved invoice. After a
duplicate-number error, "Invoice saved" still appeared. Ctrl+S and Save &
leave never took stock out.

**Cause** - print paths never called `saveInvoiceToDB`; the download path
called it after `buildPDF`; `saveInvoiceToDB` returned nothing on its error
paths, so callers could not tell.

**Rule** - save first, then make any output from the saved number.
`saveInvoiceToDB` returns the saved number or null, and callers check it.

**Guard** - none automated for the order. By hand: new invoice, Print, check
it is on the Dashboard with the number printed.

---

## ERR-025 - Dashboard "Bulk PDF" always failed

**Version:** broke in v1.10.x · fixed in v1.10.71
**Reported by:** found while writing the documentation

**Symptom** - "Could not generate any PDFs" whatever was ticked.

**Cause** - `onClick={bulkExportPDF}` passed the click event into the
function's first argument, `billsOverride`, so the event was treated as the
list of invoices. The same pattern opened Clients' Add Client with the event
as prefill.

**Rule** - never pass a handler with parameters straight to `onClick`; wrap it:
`onClick={() => fn()}`.

**Guard** - `tests/smoke.mjs` "v71 Bulk PDF downloads a PDF of the ticked
invoices".

---

## ERR-024 - A page break cut the company stamp in half

**Version:** latent since page breaks learned to respect rows (v1.10.8); made likely by the stamp (v1.10.67) · fixed in v1.10.70
**Reported by:** the maintainer, with a photo of a customer's printed invoice (2026-09-24)

**Symptom** - on a two-page invoice, the top arc of the round company stamp
printed at the foot of page 1 under "Authorized Signatory", with blank space
below it, and the rest of the stamp at the top of page 2 beside the terms.

**Cause** - the PDF is one tall capture sliced into pages. To avoid cutting
through text, buildPDF only ends a page at the top or bottom of a table row or
a `.inv-footer-block`. But the footer is two columns: bank details and terms
are stacked on the left, and the signature block sits beside them on the right.
The bottom of the bank-details block is a clean edge in the left column and
passes straight through the stamp in the right one. Nothing checked the column
next door. The stamp made it likely: a signature block with a 120px stamp is
far taller than a signature alone, so the page edge lands inside it far more
often.

**Rule** - an edge is only a place to break if *nothing* straddles it. Collect
the candidate edges, then drop every one that falls inside anything that must
stay whole: rows, footer blocks, the signature block, and every image.
`safePageBoundaries()` in `src/utils.js` does exactly that. And measure the
layout that is actually captured: the extra pages are now hidden *before* the
edges are measured, not after.

**Guard** - `scripts/tax-test.mjs` `[V70-ERR-024]` models the reported footer.
`tests/smoke.mjs` builds the dangerous invoice for real: it adds rows until the
page-1 edge falls between the bottom of the bank details and the bottom of the
signature, makes a real multi-page PDF, and fails if any page ends inside the
signature block or any image. It reads a read-only test hook,
`window.__lastPdfLayout`. Verified red: against v1.10.69 it failed with "page
ends at 1024px - CUTS THROUGH"; against v1.10.70 page 1 ends at 880px, above
the signature.

## ERR-023 - The app icon was unreadable at the size Windows actually draws it

**Version:** artwork unchanged since v1.10.7 · icon first shipped, and fixed, in v1.10.69
**Reported by:** the maintainer, from a screenshot of the extracted folder (2026-09-24)

**Symptom** - *"it looks very bad or corrupted"*. On the Desktop shortcut and
in the launcher title bar the icon was a blurry blue blob with something
indistinct inside it.

**Cause** - the icon was rendered by shrinking `public/favicon.svg`, which is
built for a browser tab and a 512px PWA tile: a #1e40af rounded square, a
#2563eb rounded square inset 4px inside it, a white panel at 15% opacity, a
26px letter and a 3px bar. At 16 pixels the two blues merge into a fuzzy
edge, the panel becomes a grey ghost, the bar becomes a smudge, and the letter
gets about six pixels of height. Nothing was corrupt; there was simply four
times more detail than the canvas could hold.

**Rule** - an icon is drawn at 16px far more often than at 256, so it is
designed at 16px and allowed extra detail as it grows, not the other way
round. Below 64px this one is a solid square and a single letter.

**Rule (second)** - build the .ico out of uncompressed BGRA bitmaps, not PNGs.
Windows 11 reads PNG-in-ICO, but .NET quietly hands back a smaller image when
asked for a PNG-compressed 256 (observed here), and older shells skip such
entries entirely. PNG is kept only for 256px, where a bitmap would be 256 KB.

**Guard** - none automated (it is a judgement about legibility). Verified by
rendering 16/24/32/48 from the shipped .ico, enlarging each with nearest-
neighbour, and looking; and by asking the Windows shell itself, through
SHGetFileInfo, what it draws for a shortcut and for the installed folder.

## ERR-022 - Every install re-downloaded 3.9 MB it already had

**Version:** shipped with the packaged release since v1.10.33 · fixed in v1.10.69
**Reported by:** the maintainer asking whether everything in the ZIP is really needed (2026-09-23)

**Symptom** - during install, on a user machine, the console prints
*"fetching eng.traineddata from jsDelivr..."* and pulls 3.9 MB down. The ZIP
they just downloaded already contains that exact file.

**Cause** - `bundle-tesseract-assets.mjs` is wired to `postinstall`, so it runs
wherever `npm install` runs - including on the user machine. It rebuilds
`public/tesseract/` from node_modules and downloads the English OCR data. In a
source checkout that is right: `public/` is what `vite build` copies into
`dist/`. In an installed copy it is pure waste - a release install serves
`dist/`, and `dist/tesseract/` already holds all 18 files including the 3.9 MB
language data. The download also added a network dependency, and a few more
seconds, to an install that did not need either.

**Rule** - a `postinstall` hook runs on every machine that installs the
package, not just yours. Anything in it that only makes sense in a source
checkout has to detect that it is in one. Here: a source checkout has
`public/` (it is in git), an installed copy does not.

**Guard** - none automated. Verified by hand: with `node_modules` present and
`public/` renamed away - the exact shape of a release install - the script now
prints "Installed copy - OCR files already ship in dist/. Nothing to do." and
creates nothing.

## ERR-021 - The installer needed administrator rights it could never ask for

**Version:** broke in v1.10.44, with the HTA launcher · fixed in v1.10.69
**Reported by:** found while answering "can you confirm there will be no installation error" (2026-09-23)

**Symptom** - on a PC without Node.js, the install appears to run and then
stops with *"ERROR: npm install failed. See above."* Nothing above it explains
anything. On a PC that already had Node.js, the same installer worked - so it
looked fine in every test done on a developer machine.

**Cause** - `install-windows.ps1` fetched the official Node.js **.msi** and ran
`msiexec /i ... /qn`. That MSI installs per-machine into `C:\Program Files\`,
which requires elevation, and `/qn` means fully silent - so Windows cannot even
show the UAC prompt that would grant it. On a standard account it installed
nothing. The exit code was never checked and `node -v` was never re-tested, so
the script walked straight into `npm install`, which failed because npm did not
exist, and reported that instead of the real cause.

**Rule** - an installer for non-technical users asks for no privileges it
cannot obtain, and a step that can fail is followed by a check that it did not.
Node.js now comes from the official portable **.zip**, unpacked into
`_system\node\`: no admin, no UAC, no registry, nothing written outside the app
folder, and an existing system Node.js is left untouched and preferred.

**Rule (second)** - the machine that builds the release already has every
dependency, so it can never exercise the branch that installs them. Test the
install with the dependency hidden.

**Guard** - none automated (a real install takes three minutes and 30 MB).
Verified by hand: extract the ZIP, run `install-windows.ps1` from a shell whose
PATH has had every folder containing `node.exe` removed, and confirm
`_system\node\node.exe` appears, `npm install` completes, and the app serves
HTTP 200. Done 2026-09-23: 164 seconds, no prompts.

## ERR-020 - Launcher buttons ran edge to edge, touching both window sides

**Version:** broke in v1.10.44, with the HTA launcher itself · fixed in v1.10.69
**Reported by:** the maintainer, from a screenshot (2026-09-23)

**Symptom** - every button in the launcher window stretched from the far left
edge to the far right edge, with no margin at all, as if the stylesheet had
not loaded.

**Cause** - the buttons lived in `<main>`, styled `main { padding: 16px 24px }`.
`<main>` is the one HTML5 sectioning element Internet Explorer never
implemented - `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>` and `<nav>` all arrived in
IE9, `<main>` never did. Trident treats it as an unknown inline element, so
the padding was dropped and the full-width buttons sized against `<body>`. The
same markup is correct in every other browser, which is why it read as fine in
review.

**Rule** - the HTA renders in Trident, not in a modern browser. Use `<div>` for
layout containers there, and treat anything added to HTML after 2011 as absent

the markup and assume.

**Guard** - none automated (nothing can drive `mshta` headlessly). Verified by
launching the packaged launcher in all three states and looking at each one.

## ERR-019 - "Update Now" and "Open GST Billing" did nothing at all, silently

**Version:** broke in v1.10.44, when the HTA launcher replaced the .bat installer · fixed in v1.10.69
**Reported by:** found while auditing the repo for stale install instructions (2026-09-23)

**Symptom** - three buttons inside the app did nothing when clicked. No error,
no window, no toast, no console message: **Settings → Check for Updates →
Update Now**, the **Update Now** button in the update-available dialog, and
**Open GST Billing** on the "server needs a quick start" screen.

**Cause** - all three were `<a href="freegstbill://…">` links. Those custom URL
protocols were registered in the Windows registry by the old
`Install FreeGSTBill.bat`. The HTA launcher replaced that installer in v1.10.44
and registers no protocol at all, so from that release on the links resolved to
nothing. A browser silently ignores an unregistered protocol - there is no
error to notice, which is why it survived 25 releases. The ⚙ Control Panel was
unaffected: it posts to `/api/control-panel/launch-script`, which works.

**Rule** - a click always produces a visible result: an action, or a message
saying why not. Anything a page hands to the operating system - a custom
protocol, a `mailto:`, a file association - can fail without telling anybody,
so it is never the only path to a feature the app depends on. Where the app
already has a server endpoint that does the job, use that.

**Rule (second)** - when an installer is replaced, every registry key, protocol
handler and shortcut the old one created is a dependency the new one silently
dropped. List them and re-home each one before the old installer stops
shipping.

**Guard** - `scripts/build-release-zip.mjs` `assertNoDeadProtocolLinks()` scans
the packaged `dist/` for `freegstbill:` and `freegstbill-update:` and refuses to
build a ZIP that still contains either. Verified red: re-adding the string to
`src/App.jsx` fails the build.
